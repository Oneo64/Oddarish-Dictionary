	<p>This is the official dictionary for the constructed language Oddarish, created by Oneo64 for the personal worldbuilding project Aldraheimr and spoken by the people of Oddarsveldi. Here, you can find words presented nicely in the highest quality possible.</p>
	<p>Oddarish is a North Germanic conlang based on Old West Norse, and also the most successful conlang I have created. Containing over 2000 words, it is usable in daily conversations, storytelling, and even poetry!</p>
	<p>Like many inflection-heavy languages, such as Icelandic and Latin, Oddarish can be spoken in any word order, but SVO is used in daily conversations.</p>
	<p>Oddarish came from Fjallandic, which came from Norvunic, which came from Kagalarian. Keep in mind that this is NOT the in-lore evolution!</p>
