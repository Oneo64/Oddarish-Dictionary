# Overview
Oddarish is a North Germanic conlang based on Old West Norse, and also the most successful conlang I have created. Containing over 2000 words, it is usable in daily conversations, storytelling, and even poetry!

Oddarish was made for the worldbuilding project Aldraheimr, where it is the main spoken language in the Kingdom of Oddarsveldi.

Oddarish came from Fjallandic, which came from Norvunic, which came from Kagalarian. Keep in mind that this is NOT the in-lore evolution!
